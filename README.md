# FlightAware-Auto-Input
An old project designed to assist inputing large amount of flight numbers into the web-based flight tracker: "FlightAware"

This project requires [ChromeDriver/Chromium](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) to be placed in the same location as the script.

From my website:
"I created a script that would take all Regeneron Employee Travelers flight numbers for the day and input and display it on a flight tracking program called [FlightAware](href="https://flightaware.com/"). FlightAware would then display any flights currently in the air with Regeneron travelers. The script will prompt the user for a FlightAware username and password, then it will request you specify the location the excel sheet with flight numbers is on your PC. The Script then uses Chrome's automated browser to input the numbers into FlightAware.
